--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 8.0:
-----------
Added options "-b" "-e" and "-f" to 'link2rcs'.

Added "-l" option to 'copy'; corrected handling of tilde in src/dst args there.
Modified treatment of destination-as-directory: if more than 2 args are given,
or if the destination ends with '/', we assume the user wants to copy into the
given destination-directory.

Propagate "-t" option of 'ded' to ded-subprocesses.

Added/broke-out 'sccsdefs.h' and 'sccsname.c' for use in rewrite of 'sccsput'
(see SCCS_TOOLS).

Version 7.0:
-----------
Added "-x" option to checkin and checkout so we can effect the 3rd pathname
conversion used in 'ci' and 'co' (e.g., preserve pathnames of inputs, rather
than assuming the current directory).

Added "-T" option to rcsput and rcsget.  This specifies a different tool to
use in place of 'checkin' and 'checkout', respectively.  Note that the tool
need not be a renamed checkin or checkout -- it may be something like rlog
which can take advantage of the logic in rcsget/rcsput.

Added "-d" option to 'checkin'.

Added "-q" option to rcsget.

Corrected oversight in 'baseline' which caused permit-file to not be updated
when the "-f" option was used.

Fixes to 'ded' and 'copy' to handle tilde in their arguments more intelligently.

Version 6.0:
-----------
Rewrote 'link2rcs' into C-language to facilitate recreation of symbolic links
if they are damaged, as well as to permit creation of relative links (rather
than absolute).

Enhanced sort-commands of ded by better prompting.  Also, added 'T' toggles
and revised '#' command.  Prompt user when quitting from file-list (unless
disabled by '-n' option).

Modified/corrected 'copy' utility to handle relative pathnames in source-paths.

Added '-f' and '-l' options to 'baseline'.

Added options to checkup: -c -i, -l, -p.

Version 5.0:
-----------
Deleted utility 'rdiff', since we are now using GNU release of RCS, and need
not work around source-licensing for that tool.

Conversion to run with Apollo SR10.1:

	* the 'copy' utility is not as essential, since the new 'cp' can
	  preserve dates, but is retained because it 'cp' does not properly
	  maintain file protection.

	* the 'ded' utility has been modified to show extended ACLs and
	  apollo object (file) types.

	* some shell scripts were modified because the apollo sys5 'dirname'
	  utility broke.

Recoded from Bourne-shell into C-language (partly for better error checking,
partly to bypass bugs in apollo SR10.1 Bourne shell):

	baseline
	rcsget
	rcsput

(As part of the rewrite, added option "-a" to each utility to handle directory
names beginning with ".").

Version 4.0:							89/08/22
-----------
Corrected "make destroy" in case RCS is a symbolic link.

Minor mods/enhancements to common-library for use in other prototypes.

Added options to checkup: "-o", "-d"; added "+" interpretation to "-r".

Added CTL/R command to ded.  Corrected/enhanced "<" command.

Version 3.0:							89/05/11
-----------
Absorbed procedures from PORTUNIX and MDIFF into common-library.
Ported (a subset of) common-library to VMS as CM_TOOLS.

Notes:
This version of CM_TOOLS implements baseline and link2rcs as scripts.
A subsequent release will probably recode these to integrate them better
with 'permit'.
