--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 6.0:
-----------
Rewrote 'link2rcs' into C-language to facilitate recreation of symbolic links
if they are damaged, as well as to permit creation of relative links (rather
than absolute).

Enhanced sort-commands of ded by better prompting.  Also, added 'T' toggles
and revised '#' command.  Prompt user when quitting from file-list (unless
disabled by '-n' option).

Modified/corrected 'copy' utility to handle relative pathnames in source-paths.

Added '-f' and '-l' options to 'baseline'.

Added options to checkup: -c -i, -l, -p.

Version 5.0:
-----------
Deleted utility 'rdiff', since we are now using GNU release of RCS, and need
not work around source-licensing for that tool.

Conversion to run with Apollo SR10.1:

	* the 'copy' utility is not as essential, since the new 'cp' can
	  preserve dates, but is retained because it 'cp' does not properly
	  maintain file protection.

	* the 'ded' utility has been modified to show extended ACLs and
	  apollo object (file) types.

	* some shell scripts were modified because the apollo sys5 'dirname'
	  utility broke.

Recoded from Bourne-shell into C-language (partly for better error checking,
partly to bypass bugs in apollo SR10.1 Bourne shell):

	baseline
	rcsget
	rcsput

(As part of the rewrite, added option "-a" to each utility to handle directory
names beginning with ".").

Version 4.0:							89/08/22
-----------
Corrected "make destroy" in case RCS is a symbolic link.

Minor mods/enhancements to common-library for use in other prototypes.

Added options to checkup: "-o", "-d"; added "+" interpretation to "-r".

Added CTL/R command to ded.  Corrected/enhanced "<" command.

Version 3.0:							89/05/11
-----------
Absorbed procedures from PORTUNIX and MDIFF into common-library.
Ported (a subset of) common-library to VMS as CM_TOOLS.

Notes:
This version of CM_TOOLS implements baseline and link2rcs as scripts.
A subsequent release will probably recode these to integrate them better
with 'permit'.
