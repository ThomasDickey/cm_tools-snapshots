--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 12.0:
------------
Renamed common archive to "common.a" from "lib.a" for consistency.

Modified interface of spreadsheet put/get functions to allow arbitrary-size
fields.

New features in 'ded':

	* integrated inline and line editing (e.g., '=', '%' commands).
	* added erase-word to inline/line editing.
	* added search commands to workspace pager
	* added '-commands to repeat specific inline-commands
	* added history to inline- and workspace-commands.
	* command-editing allows ctl/V (to insert any ASCII character)

Version 11.0: 
------------
Modified all tools to use same letter for recursion (R), and links (L) options,
where applicable.

If 'copy' writes a directory where a file was, ensure that the directory-mode
is executable.

Modified 'checkin' and 'rcsput' to allow piped-in text to set default for
log-message (i.e., "-m" option).

Modified working+archive parsing in 'checkout', 'checkin', 'rcsput' and 'rcsget'
so that it more closely matches normal rcs convention (obsoleted "-x" option).

Added "-p" option to 'checkout'.

Corrected conflict between "-k" option of 'checkin' and "-d" option of 'ci'.

New features in 'ded':

	* if initial argument is a single filename rather than directory, force
	  scan-pattern to match.
	* Corrected error which caused ditto-able commands to be broken if an
	  error was reported in the 'c' commands.
	* modified 'Z' sort to difference between checkin/modification times.
	* rename file-lists as needed to track directory-renaming with the '='
	  command.
	* modified shell-command prompt to accept arbitrarily-long strings,
	  showing ellipsis for long "#" substitutions.
	* make viewports created with 'X' command treat commands that change
	  the current filelist (e.g., 'F', 'B', 'E') independent of each other.
	* make '<' command recognize substitutions for "%D" and "%d".

Version 10.0:
------------
Converted most code to ANSI (i.e., use function prototypes).

Added new utility 'vcs'

Made 'checkin' and 'checkout' work properly with root-suid.
Simplified 'checkin' somewhat by using "-d" option from RCS version 4.

New features in 'ded':

	* Made '"' command apply to 'c' commands
	* "2T" command to show how many days-old a file is.
	* added command-substitution codes u,g,v,y
	* added @-sort and D-sort
	* added CTL/G command
	* made file-list 'S' and 'P' commands 3-way (i.e., "2S" and "2P").
	* Added P-sort (sorts extended-acl-flag).

Miscellaneous fixes to common-library, including:

	* corrections to 'rcsload()' line-counts, completed code to load file
	  contents.
	* make 'rcsedit()' work in read-only mode, so we don't do unnecessary
	  file-copy.
	* make 'sccslast()' find tip-version, rather than last.

Version 9.0:
-----------
Upgrade for Apollo SR10.3.4 (ANSI cpp complaints about endif-tags, some mods
to ptypes.h, etc).

New features in 'ded':
	':' command in directory-tree,
	'cL' command in file-list,
	TAB-command in type-window.
	"-" argument causes 'ded' to read list of filenames from stdin.

Modified treatment of backslash in ded's shell commands so that only '%' and
'#' need be escaped.

Better error recovery in 'ded' for cases in which ".ftree" cannot be written,
'getwd()' fails, etc.

Modified 'rcsput' and 'rcsget' to pass-thru the "-x" option to 'checkin' and
'checkout' respectively.

Fixes to pathname computations in 'link2rcs'

Version 8.0:
-----------
Made 'copy' command recognize "~" expressions in pathnames.

Added options "-b" "-e" and "-f" to 'link2rcs'.

Added "-l" option to 'copy'; corrected handling of tilde in src/dst args there.
Modified treatment of destination-as-directory: if more than 2 args are given,
or if the destination ends with '/', we assume the user wants to copy into the
given destination-directory.

Made 'ded' recognize "~" expressions in its argument-list.
Propagate "-t" option of 'ded' to ded-subprocesses.  Made CTL/E command of
'ded' work from directory-tree to allow initial read-pattern.
Modified code which follows symbolic links so that (on Apollo) it strips off
the DSEE revision suffix, if present.

Added/broke-out 'sccsdefs.h' and 'sccsname.c' for use in rewrite of 'sccsput'
(see SCCS_TOOLS).

Corrected (for Apollo SR10.x) a bug in uid2s() and s2uid() which prevented
translation for accounts which had been disabled.

Changed sccs-directory default name from "sccs" to "SCCS".

Version 7.0:
-----------
Added "-x" option to checkin and checkout so we can effect the 3rd pathname
conversion used in 'ci' and 'co' (e.g., preserve pathnames of inputs, rather
than assuming the current directory).

Added "-T" option to rcsput and rcsget.  This specifies a different tool to
use in place of 'checkin' and 'checkout', respectively.  Note that the tool
need not be a renamed checkin or checkout -- it may be something like rlog
which can take advantage of the logic in rcsget/rcsput.

Added "-d" option to 'checkin'.

Added "-q" option to rcsget.

Corrected oversight in 'baseline' which caused permit-file to not be updated
when the "-f" option was used.

Fixes to 'ded' and 'copy' to handle tilde in their arguments more intelligently.

Version 6.0:
-----------
Rewrote 'link2rcs' into C-language to facilitate recreation of symbolic links
if they are damaged, as well as to permit creation of relative links (rather
than absolute).

Enhanced sort-commands of ded by better prompting.  Also, added 'T' toggles
and revised '#' command.  Prompt user when quitting from file-list (unless
disabled by '-n' option).

Modified/corrected 'copy' utility to handle relative pathnames in source-paths.

Added '-f' and '-l' options to 'baseline'.

Added options to checkup: -c -i, -l, -p.

Version 5.0:
-----------
Deleted utility 'rdiff', since we are now using GNU release of RCS, and need
not work around source-licensing for that tool.

Conversion to run with Apollo SR10.1:

	* the 'copy' utility is not as essential, since the new 'cp' can
	  preserve dates, but is retained because it 'cp' does not properly
	  maintain file protection.

	* the 'ded' utility has been modified to show extended ACLs and
	  apollo object (file) types.

	* some shell scripts were modified because the apollo sys5 'dirname'
	  utility broke.

Recoded from Bourne-shell into C-language (partly for better error checking,
partly to bypass bugs in apollo SR10.1 Bourne shell):

	baseline
	rcsget
	rcsput

(As part of the rewrite, added option "-a" to each utility to handle directory
names beginning with ".").

Version 4.0:							89/08/22
-----------
Corrected "make destroy" in case RCS is a symbolic link.

Minor mods/enhancements to common-library for use in other prototypes.

Added options to checkup: "-o", "-d"; added "+" interpretation to "-r".

Added CTL/R command to ded.  Corrected/enhanced "<" command.

Version 3.0:							89/05/11
-----------
Absorbed procedures from PORTUNIX and MDIFF into common-library.
Ported (a subset of) common-library to VMS as CM_TOOLS.

Notes:
This version of CM_TOOLS implements baseline and link2rcs as scripts.
A subsequent release will probably recode these to integrate them better
with 'permit'.
