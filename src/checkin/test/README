--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These scripts test the non-privileged operation of 'checkin'.

The following work remains to be done (1992/02/11):

	* branch logic is incomplete; 'checkin' does not allow a branch to be
	  made unless a lock is placed on the trunk at that point.  This is
	  not the correct behavior (cf: case3_e.sh)

	* need a test-case for "-B" option, both for initial insertion, and
	  update within a baseline.

	* need simple test cases for 'rcsput'
