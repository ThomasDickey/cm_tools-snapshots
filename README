--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module consists of the following programs (or scripts):

	baseline
	checkin
	checkout
	checkup
	copy
	ded
	link2rcs
	permit
	rcsget
	rcsput

To build the system from sources, do the following:

	(1) Put the bin-directory of this module in your path.
	(2) Adjust the top-level makefile, if necessary, to reflect the
	    installation-path (INSTALL_PATH) of these programs
	(3) Adjust the top-level makefile, if necessary, to point to the
	    directory containing the rcs binary programs (RCS_PATH).

Make the system by typing

	make all

This will build all binary programs into staging directories (bin) below
the src-directory, then install them into the top-level bin-directory.

You may build the binary programs into the staging directories alone,
and run tests by typing

	cd src
	make all
	make run_tests

Some of the tests write into a log-file.  Others do not (since the program
changes behavior when piping output).  Note that few are self-contained;
for example, the checkin and checkout package tests assume that the other
utility (as well as the rcs utilities) are available.

When you are satisfied that the individual programs are ready for
installation, type (from this directory)

	make install

That will first copy from the staging directories, then from the top-level
bin-directory to the $(INSTALL_PATH) directory.
