<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>checkout<F0> <#1f> RCS check-out utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>checkout<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkout<F0> is an extension of the RCS utility <F31>co<F0>.  
It uses a file's check-in date to set the file's modification date 
after check-out.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkout<F0> uses the rcs utility <F31>co<F0>.  It is normally 
invoked from the <F31>rcsget<F0> script, but may be invoked in a 
standalone manner.  <F31>Checkout<F0> differs from <F31>co<F0> primarily 
in its treatment to the delta date: after invoking <F31>co<F0>, <F31>checkout
<F0> sets the file's modification date to match the delta-date for 
the extracted version.

<subheader>

<F31@R>Set-UID Operation

<paragraph>

<F30@R>Like the <F31@R>checkin<F30@R> utility, <F31@R>checkout<F30@R> properly 
handles set-uid operation for a non-root effective user.  The archived 
files are owned by the effective user, and the checked-out files are 
owned by the real user.

<F30@R>Note that since <F31@R>checkin<F30@R> initializes the access list 
in the archive files, the real user must appear on the access list 
to lock a file.  Of course, if no lock is made, then the user need 
not be on the access list.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkout<F0> recognizes all of the <#7f><F31>co<F0>" options 
except for the <#7f>-<F31>d<F0>" cutoff date.  Instead, the <#7f>-<F31>c<F0>" 
option is used:

<options>

-<F31>c<F0> <F32>cutoff<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>rcs<F0> cutoff 
date, in SCCS-format

<Tab><Tab>YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

<Tab>Punctuation in the date is permitted.  For example,

<subfixed>

-c 77/2/2 9:22:25

-c 770202092225

<options>

<Tab>represent the same date.  This option is translated to the <F31>co<F0> 
<#7f>-<F31>d<F0>" option.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F31>checkout<F0>, you must provide one or 
more file names.  For each name, checkout parses the leaf-name and 
extracts the specified version from the <#7f>./RCS" directory.

<header>

<|,2>ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkout<F0> is a C-language program.  It invokes <F31>co<F0> 
via an <F32>execlp<F0> call (so that <F31>co<F0> must be in your 
path), and performs pre- and postprocessing of the archive and working 
file to determine the delta-date to use for the extracted file. Environment 
variables used by checkout include:

<options,
	Left Tab =		0/0.75/1.50 inches>

<F49@R>RCS_DIR<F30@R><Tab>if defined, specifies the directory in which <F32@R>rcs
<F30@R> archive files are found.  Normally files are found in <#7f>./RCS".

<options>

<F49>TZ<F0><Tab>is the unix time zone, which is overridden internally 
so that file modification dates are independent of the local time 
zone.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

Checkout uses the following files:

<options>

<F49>co<F0><Tab>the RCS check-out program

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F30@R>This does not handle <F32@R>rcs<F30@R> branches properly.

<F31@R>Checkout<F30@R> does not handle the <#7f>-j" option of <F31@R>co<F30@R>.
