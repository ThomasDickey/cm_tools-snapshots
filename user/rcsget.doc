<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>rcsget<F0> <#1f> Rcs check-out script

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>rcsget<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is a simple interface to <F32>rcs<F0> (<F31>r<F0>evision 
<F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem), which is used to extract files 
from <F32>rcs<F0> archives.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> checks out (extracts) files from an <F32>rcs<F0> 
archive which have been checked in using <F31>rcsput <F0>or<F31> 
checkin<F0>.  <F31>Rcsput<F0> checks in files, retaining their modification 
date as the check-in date. <F31> Rcsget<F0> extracts a given version 
of one or more files, and sets their modification date to match the 
check-in date.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is a directory-recursive interface to the <F31>co<F0> 
utility which does special things with the file modification date.  
Most of its options are passed to <F31>co<F0>, and then interpreted 
to determine the correct modification date.  Options special to <F31>rcsget
<F0> are:

<options>

-<F31>c<F0> <F32>cutoff<F0><Tab>specifies the <F32>rcs<F0> cutoff 
date, in SCCS-format

<Tab><Tab>YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]

<Tab>Punctuation in the date is permitted.  For example,

<subfixed>

-c 77/2/2 9:22:25

<subfixed>

-c 770202092225

<options>

<Tab>represent the same date.  This option is translated to the <F31>co<F0> 
"-<F31>d<F0>" option.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F31>rcsget<F0>, you must provide one or more 
names.  They may be either file or directory names.

<F31>Rcsget<F0> resolves names until it finds one of the form <#7f>RCS/<F32>fi
le<F0>,v" before invoking <F31>co<F0>.  If it finds a directory 
(other than <#7f>RCS"), <F31>rcsget<F0> will recur on itself to extract 
files at lower levels.

<header>

<|,2>ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is a Bourne shell script.  On Apollo DOMAIN/IX, it 
uses System<SP>5 features, including <F32>getopt<SP>(1)<F0>.  Environment 
variables used by <F31>rcsget<F0> include:

<options>

<F49>RUNLIB<F0><Tab>identifies the execution path of this tool, and 
of subordinate components (e.g., <F31>checkout<F0>).<Tab>

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> uses the following files:

<options>

<F49>rcsget<F0><Tab>the Bourne shell script<Tab>

<F49>checkout<F0><Tab>a utility which invokes <F31>co<F0> and then 
modifies the file's modification date  so that it matches the version-date 
selected which was extracted via <F31>co<F0>.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES
