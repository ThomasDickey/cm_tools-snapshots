NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>rcsget<F0> <#1f> rcs check-out utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>rcsget<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is a simple interface to <F32>rcs<F0> (<F31>r<F0>evision 
<F31>c<F0>ontrol <F31>s<F0>ystem), which is used to extract files 
from <F32>rcs<F0> archives.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> checks out (extracts) files from an <F32>rcs<F0> 
archive which have been checked in using <F31>rcsput <F0>or<F31> 
checkin<F0>.  <F31>Rcsput<F0> checks in files, retaining their modification 
date as the check-in date. <F31> Rcsget<F0> extracts a given version 
of one or more files, and sets their modification date to match the 
check-in date.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is a directory-recursive interface to the <F31>co<F0> 
utility which does special things with the file modification date.  
Most of its options are passed to <F31>co<F0>, and then interpreted 
to determine the correct modification date.  Options special to <F31>rcsget
<F0> are:

<options>

-<F31>a<F0><Tab>permits <F31>rcsget<F0> to process directory names 
beginning with <#7f>.".

-<F31>d<F0><Tab>directs <F31>rcsget<F0> to scan the <F32>rcs<F0> directories 
to find the list of files which are checked-out.  Otherwise, <F31>rcsget<F0> 
will select only those files which are already checked-out.

-<F31>n<F0><Tab>no-op mode directs <F31>rcsget<F0> to show what files 
would be checked out without actually checking them out.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

To extract files using <F31>rcsget<F0>, you must provide one or more 
names.  They may be either file or directory names.

<F31>Rcsget<F0> resolves names until it finds one of the form <#7f>RCS/<F32>fil
e<F0>,v" before invoking <F31>co<F0>.  If it finds a directory (other 
than <#7f>RCS"), <F31>rcsget<F0> will recur to extract files at lower 
levels.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> is written in C, and runs on UNIX<F6>T<F0> systems.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Rcsget<F0> uses the following files:

<options>

<F49>checkout<F0><Tab>a utility which invokes <F31>co<F0> and then 
modifies the file's modification date so that it matches the version-date 
selected which was extracted via <F31>co<F0>.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

None.
