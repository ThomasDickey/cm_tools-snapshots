<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>checkup<F0> <#1f> RCS/SCCS check-in status

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>checkup<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkup<F0> examines one or more text files, and shows which 
ones have not been archived with either <F32>rcs<F0> or <F32>sccs<F0>.  
It also shows those which have been modified since the last check-in.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkup<F0> scans each filename given as an argument, looking 
first for a corresponding <F32>rcs<F0> archive, then for an <F32>sccs<F0> 
archive.  For each file, <F31>checkup<F0> determines if the file

<bullet>

<F6>S<F0><Tab>has been archived,

<F6>S<F0><Tab>has been locked for modification,

<F6>S<F0><Tab>has been modified since its check-in date, or has 
a modification date older than the check-in date.

<paragraph>

If a directory name is given, <F31>checkup<F0> scans all files in 
the directory.  In either case, checkup attempts to display the offending 
files in the context of a directory tree.

The directory-tree display is written to the standard error stream.  <F31>Check
up<F0> writes to the standard output a list of the absolute pathnames 
for each file.  This list may be piped into other utilities, such 
as the directory editor <F31>ded<F0>.

<header>

OPTIONS

<options>

<F30@R>-<F31@R>a<F30@R><Tab>permits <F31@R>checkup<F30@R> to examine directories 
(and their subdirectories) whose leafnames begin with <#7f>.".  These 
are otherwise ignored.

-<F31>q<F0><Tab>makes the listing less verbose (i.e., suppresses 
display of the directory tree).  If standard output is not piped to 
a file, the list of absolute filenames will be shown on your terminal 
instead.

-<F31>r<F0> <F32>REV<F0><Tab>reports all working files whose highest 
version is below <F32>REV<F0>.  For example, <#7f>-<F31>r<SP><F0>2" 
will report all files which are checked in, but having version numbers 
below <#7f>2.0".

<|,2>-<F31>s<F0><Tab>same as <#7f>-<F31>q<F0>".

-<F31>t<F0><Tab>directs <F31>checkup<F0> to suppress files whose 
extension ends in a default list: <#7f>.bak", <#7f>.i", <#7f>.log", 
<#7f>.out" and <#7f>.tmp".

-<F31>v<F0><Tab>makes the display more verbose; the names of files 
which cannot be opened are reported.

-<F31>x<F0> <F32>string<F0><Tab>specifies an extension (filename 
suffix).  All filenames ending in this extension are ignored.  The 
first character of the string doubles as a delimiter (e.g., <#7f>.").  
If it is repeated in the string, <F31>checkup<F0> parses two extensions.  
The first extension, if any, is used to conditionally ignore the second.  
That is, if a file with the first extension exists, the file with 
the second is ignored.
