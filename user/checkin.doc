<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>checkin<F0> <#1f> rcs check-in utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>checkin<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> is an extension of the RCS utility <F31>ci<F0>.  
It uses the file's modification date rather than the current date 
as the RCS delta-date.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> uses the <F32>rcs<F0> utility <F31>ci<F0>.  It 
is normally invoked from the <F31>rcsput<F0> script, but may be invoked 
in a standalone manner.  <F31>Checkin<F0> differs from <F31>ci<F0> 
primarily in its treatment of the delta date: after invoking <F31>ci<F0>, 
<F31>checkin<F0> modifies the delta-date in the archive to reflect 
the file's modification date.

This is the fundamental advantage offered by <F31>checkin<F0>.  The 
ordinary <F32>rcs<F0> methodology uses the current date as the check-in 
date.  This works well only for large projects in which a central 
project administrator is responsible for controlling the versions 
of source files.  It does not work well for small projects, for which <F32>rcs
<F0>'s primary advantage is its compact storage of multiple versions 
of a file.

By using the file's modification date as a reference, you can more 
easily back up to a meaningful version <#1f> by date, rather than 
version number.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> recognizes all of the <#7f><F31>ci<F0>" options.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> is used exactly as one would use <F31>ci<F0>.  
Place a lock on the file using the <#7f>-<F31>l<F0>" option with <F31>ci<F0> 
(or with <F31>co<F0>) when you wish to edit a file.  Check the file 
in using the <#7f>-<F31>u<F0>" option to retain a working copy after 
modification.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> is a C-language program.  It invokes <F31>ci<F0> 
via an <F32>execlp<F0> call (so that <F31>ci<F0> must be in your 
path), and performs pre- and postprocessing of the archive and working 
file to determine the version to which the file's modification date 
applies.

<|,2><F31>Checkin<F0> uses the following environment variables:

<options,
	Left Tab =		0/0.25 inches>

<F49>TZ<F0><Tab>is the unix time zone, which is overridden internally 
so that file modification dates are independent of the local time 
zone.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> uses the following files

<options>

<F49>ci<F0><Tab>the RCS check-in program

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Checkin<F0> does not currently handle branch deltas.

<F31>Checkin<F0> assumes that the archive file resides in the directory 
<#7f>./RCS".
