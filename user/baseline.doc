NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>baseline<F0> <#1f> rcs utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>baseline<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> permits you to set a baseline version in one or 
more RCS files.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> adds a baseline (placeholder) version to one or 
more RCS archives.  The effective check-in time for the file is the 
file's last check-in date (before <F31>baseline<F0> is invoked)

<F6>!<F0>.  A baseline version consists of a group of files which 
can be referenced by a common version number.  The baseline program 
uses for this purpose 2.0, 3.0, etc

<F6>@<F0>.  After baselining, you may use <F31>checkout<F0> to obtain 
a particular set of files.  For example,

<fixed>

checkout -r2.0 file

<paragraph>

obtains the baseline <#7f>2.0" version, while

<fixed>

checkout -r2 file1 file2 file3

<paragraph>

obtains the last development version beginning with <#7f>2.0", but 
before <#7f>3.0".

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> recognizes several options:

<options>

-<F32>integer<Tab><F0>the new baseline version, specified as a whole 
number after a hyphen, e.g.,

<fixed>

<Tab><Tab>baseline -2 file1 file2 file3

<options>

-<F31>a<F0><Tab>permits baseline to process files in directories beginning 
with <#7f>.".

-<F31>m<F32>msg<F0><Tab>adds the string <#7f>--<SP><F32>msg<F0>" to 
the default baseline revision message <#7f><F49>BASELINE<F0> <F32>date<F0>".

-<F31>n<F0><Tab>runs <F31>baseline<F0> in no-op mode, showing where 
permissions would be purged, and listing files which would be baselined.

-<F31>r<F0><Tab>permits <F31>baseline<F0> to run recursively when 
it encounters a non-RCS directory.

-<F31>v<F0><Tab>makes the baseline process more verbose by causing 
permit, checkin and checkout to show their actions.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

Before invoking <F31>baseline<F0>, ensure that all of the files to 
be baselined have been checked into <F32>rcs<F0> (e.g., with <#7f><F31>checkin
<F0> -u").  This is easily done using the directory editor <F31>ded<F0>.

<F31>Baseline<F0> operates only upon files which have been 
checked into <F32>rcs<F0> (i.e., a corresponding archive file exists 
in the subdirectory <#7f>RCS").

<F31>Baseline<F0> requires that all of the working files have been 
checked in (i.e., with the <#7f>-u" option so that they are retained 
as working files).

<F31>Baseline<F0> first invokes <F31>permit<F0> (to ensure that you 
have permission to place locks in the directory, then to purge the 
archive access lists, and finally to set the baseline-version for 
the directory).  It then invokes <F31>checkin<F0> and <F31>checkout<F0> 
(which must be in your path) to first place a lock on the specified 
files, and then to check-in the file with the new, baseline version.

If any files are found which are locked, <F31>baseline<F0> prints 
an error message and halts.  Similarly, an attempt made to baseline 
a file with a lower version than has been archived will result in 
an error.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> is written in C, and runs under <F30@C>unix<F6@C>T<F0> 
systems.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> uses the following files

<options>

<F49>permit<F0><Tab>the RCS directory-permissions utility

<F49>checkin<F0><Tab>the RCS check-in package

<F49>checkout<F0><Tab>the RCS check-out package

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> does not currently handle branch deltas.
