USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>baseline<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> permits you to set a baseline version in one or 
more RCS files.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> adds a baseline (placeholder) version to one or 
more RCS archives.  The effective check-in time for the file is the 
file's last check-in date (before <F31>baseline<F0> is invoked)

<F6>!<F0>.  A baseline version consists of a group of files which 
can be referenced by a common version number.  The baseline program 
uses for this purpose 2.0, 3.0, etc

<F6>@<F0>.  After baselining, you may use <F31>checkout<F0> to 
obtain a particular set of files.  For example,

<fixed>

checkout -r2.0 file

<paragraph>

obtains the baseline <#7f>2.0" version, while

<fixed>

checkout -r2 file1 file2 file3

<paragraph>

obtains the last development version beginning with <#7f>2.0", but 
before <#7f>3.0".

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> recognizes a single option: the new baseline version, 
specified as a whole number after a hyphen, e.g.,

<fixed>

baseline -2 file1 file2 file3

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

Before invoking <F31>baseline<F0>, ensure that all of the files to 
be baselined have been checked into <F32>rcs<F0> (e.g., with <#7f><F31>checkin
<F0> -u").  This is easily done using the directory editor <F31>ded<F0>.

<F31>Baseline<F0> operates only upon files which have been checked 
into <F32>rcs<F0> (i.e., a corresponding archive file exists in the 
subdirectory <#7f>RCS").

<header>

<|,2>ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> is a Bourne-shell script.  It invokes <F31>checkin<F0> 
and <F31>checkout<F0> (which must be in your path) to first place 
a lock on the specified files, and then to check-in the file with 
the new, baseline version.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> uses the following files

<options>

<F49>checkin<F0><Tab>the RCS check-in package

<F49>checkout<F0><Tab>the RCS check-out package

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Baseline<F0> does not check in a tree of files; it operates 
only upon files in the current working directory (with the implied 
subdirectory <#7f>./RCS").

<F31>Baseline<F0> does not currently handle branch deltas.

<F31>Baseline<F0> assumes that all of the working files have been 
checked in (i.e., with the <#7f>-u" option so that they are retained 
as working files).

<F31>Baseline<F0> assumes that the baseline version is higher than 
any version in the  archive.
