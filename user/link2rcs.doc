<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>link2rcs<F0> <#1f> rcs directory template

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>link2rcs<F32> [options] [file-specifications]

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> makes (an empty) template of an existing directory 
tree.  All directory names are copied; <#7f>RCS" directories are transformed 
into symbolic links pointing to the original tree.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> is used to make a working copy of a source-controlled 
module which is configured in a tree of directories (e.g., bin, lib, 
include, src, with dependent subdirectories).  By making a template 
directory (i.e., with the same relative pathnames), you may check-out 
files and continue to develop the module.  By making symbolic links 
to the original set of <F32>rcs<F0> directories, <F31>link2rcs<F0> 
facilitates the use of <F32>rcs<F0>: <F31>ci<F0> and <F31>co<F0> 
assume that the <F32>rcs<F0> files are in a subdirectory named <#7f>RCS".

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> recognizes the following options:

<options>

-<F31>s<F0> <F32>path<F0><Tab>specifies the source directory.  Normally 
you need not specify this; it defaults to <#7f>.".

-<F31>d<F0> <F32>path<F0><Tab>specifies the destination directory.  
You must always specify this.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

Normally, you use <F31>link2rcs<F0> when constructing a development 
directory based on an existing source tree.  To copy an entire tree, 
change your shell's working directory to the source directory (i.e., 
using the <#7f>cd" command) and type

<fixed>

link2rcs -d <F48>dst_dir<F0> .

<paragraph>

where <F32>dst_dir<F0> is the name of the (existing) directory under 
which you wish to create the template directory, and the <#7f>." specifies 
the current working directory.  If you wish to copy only some of the 
directories, type their names instead of <#7f>.".

<|,2><F31>Link2rcs<F0> makes a list of all directories under the 
source directory and attempts to create a corresponding template under 
the destination directory.  Each time it finds a directory named <#7f>RCS" 
it makes a symbolic link; otherwise it makes directories to match 
those in the source tree.

If any of the names which <F31>link2rcs<F0> plans to create already 
exists, it halts with an error message.

When you have created the template tree, you may use <F31>rcsget<F0> 
to check-out files into the destination tree.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> is a Bourne-shell script which uses the System<SP>5 
utility <F31>getopt<F0>, as well as the unix<F6>T<F0> <F31>find<F0> 
utility.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> consists of a single shell script file.

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Link2rcs<F0> does not know how to update a destination tree 
by adding new directory names.  A merge/update facility would be valuable 
<#1f> but should be done in 

<header>
