<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>copy<F0> <#1f> unix copy utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>copy<F0> [-i] [-v] file1 file2

<F31>copy<F0> [-i] [-v] file ... directory

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is an extension of the basic unix <F31>cp<F0> utility.  
It copies files, preserving their modification date.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> copies <F32>file1<F0> onto <F32>file2<F0>.  It preserves 
the existing mode of <F32>file2<F0>.  If <F32>file2<F0> did not 
exist, <F31>copy<F0> uses the mode of the source file.

<F31>Copy<F0> can also be used to copy one or more files into <F32>directory
<F0>, without changing their original filenames.  It refuses to copy 
a file onto itself.

In all cases, <F32>file2<F0> will be set to the same modification 
date as <F32>file1<F0>.  The owner of the file will be the same as 
the owner of the process which invokes <F31>copy<F0>.  Unless the 
<#7f>-<F31>i<F0>" option is used, <F31>copy<F0> ignores permissions 
of the (previous) destination file.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> recognizes options similar to those of <F31>cp<F0>, 
but with extensions:

<options>

-<F31>d<F0><Tab>all names given are treated as the destination; the 
source names are obtained by taking the leaves and looking for them 
in the current working directory.  This is provided to simplify installation 
of files in a directory.

-<F31>i<F0><Tab>prompt with the name of the file whenever the copy 
will cause an old file to be overwritten.  A <#7f>y" answer causes 
copy to continue.  Any other answer prevents it from overwriting the 
file.

-<F31>v<F0><Tab>verbose mode directs <F31>copy<F0> to print the 
names (to standard error) of the files which it copies.  On Apollo, 
repeating this option causes <F31>copy<F0> to show the underlying 
<#7f><F31>cpf<F0>" command as well.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is used exactly as one would use <F31>cp<F0>.

<header>

<|,2>ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is a C-language program which runs in a unix environment.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is a single binary file, <#7f>copy".  On the Apollo 
DOMAIN/IX system it invokes the native <#7f>cpf" command to copy files 
while preserving their object types (see OBTY).

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> does not currently know how to handle symbolic links 
and special files.  It does not support the <#7f>-<F31>r<F0>" option 
provided by some unix <#7f><F31>cp<F0>" utilities.
