<|,1>NAME

<paragraph>

<F31>copy<F0> <#1f> unix copy utility

<header>

USAGE

<paragraph>

<F31>copy<F0> [options] file1 file2

<F31>copy<F0> [options] file ... directory

<header>

SYNOPSIS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is an extension of the basic unix <F31>cp<F0> utility.  
It copies files, preserving their modification date.

<header>

DESCRIPTION

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> copies <F32>file1<F0> onto <F32>file2<F0>.  It preserves 
the existing mode of <F32>file2<F0>.  If <F32>file2<F0> did not 
exist, <F31>copy<F0> uses the mode of the source file.

<F31>Copy<F0> can also be used to copy one or more files into <F32>directory
<F0>, without changing their original filenames.  It refuses to copy 
a file onto itself.

<F30@R>Except for symbolic links<F0>, <F32>file2<F0> will be set to 
the same modification date as <F32>file1<F0>.  The owner of the file 
will be the same as the owner of the process which invokes <F31>copy<F0>.  
Unless the <#7f>-<F31>i<F0>" option is used, <F31>copy<F0> ignores 
permissions of the (previous) destination file.

<header>

OPTIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> recognizes options similar to those of <F31>cp<F0>, 
but with extensions:

<options>

-<F31>d<F0><Tab>all names given are treated as the destination; the 
source names are obtained by taking the leaves and looking for them 
in the current working directory.  This is provided to simplify installation 
of files in a directory.

-<F31>i<F0><Tab>prompt with the name of the file whenever the copy 
will cause an old file to be overwritten.  A <#7f>y" answer causes 
copy to continue.  Any other answer prevents it from overwriting the 
file.

-<F31>m<F0><Tab>permits you to merge directories.  If the source 
and destination are directories, <F31>copy<F0> will normally create 
a new directory under the destination with the same leaf name as the 
source.  For example,

<fixed>

<Tab><Tab>copy /local/bin /usr/local/bin

<options>

<Tab>will create and copy into the directory <#7f>/usr/local/bin/bin" 
if <#7f>/usr/local/bin" exists.  Use the <#7f>-<F31>m<F0>" option 
to copy onto an existing directory.

<|,2>-<F31>n<F0><Tab>disables the actual creation or modification 
of files, and (depending on the level of verboseness) shows the effect 
which the <F31>copy<F0> command would have.

<F30@R>-<F31@R>s<F30@R><Tab>enables the set-uid and set-gid file modes in 
the target.

-<F31>u<F0><Tab>resets the effective uid before executing.  If <F31>copy<F0> 
is invoked from a set-uid program, this undoes the effect of the set-uid 
by restoring the original permissions of the user.

-<F31>v<F0><Tab>verbose mode directs <F31>copy<F0> to print the 
names (to standard error) of the files which it copies.  On Apollo, 
repeating this option causes <F31>copy<F0> to show the underlying 
<#7f><F31>cpf<F0>" command as well.

<header>

OPERATIONS

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is used exactly as one would use <F31>cp<F0> <F30@R>(for 
file-copying).  Directory copying is performed without the <#7f>-<F31@R>r<F30@R>" 
option of <F31@R>cp<F30@R>.

<header>

ENVIRONMENT

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is a C-language program which runs in a unix environment.

<header>

FILES

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> is a single binary file, <#7f>copy".  On the Apollo 
DOMAIN/IX system it invokes the native <#7f>cpf" command to copy files 
while preserving their object types (see OBTY).

<header>

ANTICIPATED CHANGES

<paragraph>

<F31>Copy<F0> does not currently know how to handle special files 
(e.g., <F31>/dev/tty<F0>).
